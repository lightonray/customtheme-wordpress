This is my first custom wordpress theme

In order to install this theme in your wordpress project copy the folder megaparts-theme form the repository and paste in on the theme folder which has this directory "nameofwordpresssite/app/public/wp-content/themes".

After your paste the folder you can go in Admin Panel of your WordPress site and go to themes. You can see the newly added theme appear, click activate and boom. You are good to go!

Thank you!
